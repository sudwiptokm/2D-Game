# 2D-Game
 A simple mario type game built entirely with p5.js library
 
 
It was a project created by me from scratch for my university project. It's just a single level but can be further extended easily by using the fuctions and template used in this code. The possibility is extremely high if invested enough resource. 


How to run this:
Use VS Code Live Server or Bracket to run this code/game on your brower to get the whole experience
